# btui — Bash Terminal User Interface

`btui` is a pure-bash library for building small, toolkit-style TUIs. Unlike curses-based libraries, which require taking over the entire terminal screen, `btui` is designed specifically for minimal UI elements such as menus and dialogs that only take up a part of the screen, then disappear.
